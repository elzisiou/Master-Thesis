The purpose of this thesis was to study and implement computational methods for solving PDEs arising from 1D and 2D problems in heterogeneous systems. Differential equations are of high importance and model many physical and scientific problems. After a thorough review of previous work on the field two algorithms were chosen to be implemented. The cyclic reduction algorithm and the block cyclic reduction algorithm were implemented for CPU and ported to GPU to study the performance. The CPU code was implemented in C and Matlab. The GPU code was implemented in NVIDIA CUDA. Due to numerically instability of Block Cyclic Reduction the Buneman variant was implemented. Extensive experiments were performed and their results were compared and studied. It was proved that in GPUs the Buneman algorithm shows up to 25x speed-up in relation to CPU and cyclic reduction up to 8x. That concludes that GPU can be used to solve efficiently, accurately and clearly faster these problems especially in two dimensions were the speed-up was particularly remarkable and the computational load extremely large.
